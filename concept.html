<br>
discriminative: Algorithms that try to learn p(y|x) directly (such as logistic regression), or algorithms that try to learn mappings directly from the space of inputs X to the labels {0, 1}, (such as the perceptron algorithm) are called discriminative learning algorithms.
<br><br>
generative: For instance, if y indicates whether an example is a dog (0) or an elephant (1), then p(x|y = 0) models the distribution of dogs' features, and p(x|y = 1) models the distribution of elephants' features.
