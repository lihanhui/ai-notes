<h2>false positive etc.</h2>
<p>false positive（FP）: indicates presence of a condition when in reality it is not present - 误诊为有病</p>
<p>false negative（FN）: indicates no presence of a condition (the result is negative), when in reality it is present - 误诊为无病</p>
<p>true positive（TP）: 正确的判定为有病</p>
<p>true negative（TN）: 正确的判定为无病</p>

<h2>mAP</h2>
<h3>IoU</h3>
<p>Intersection over Union is a ratio between the intersection and the union of the predicted boxes and the ground truth boxes.

<h3>Precision and Recall</h3>
<p>Precision = TP/(TP+FP) <br>
Recall = TP/(TP+FN)</p>

<h3>mAP</h3>
<p>The AP (average precision) is defined as the mean of the Precision values at these chosen N Recall values. </p>
<p>The mAP hence is the Mean of all the Average Precision values across all your classes</p>

<h2>Local response normalization</h2>
implements some kind of lateral inhibition inspired by real neurons; see alexnet section 3.3 for details.<br>

<h2>spatial pyramid pooling</h2> 
provide fixed-sized flattened vector to fully connected convolutional layer inspired by Bag of Words (BoW) to adapt not fixed-sized images,  normally fixed-sized images are feedded into CNN by resizing method such as crop, or warp.
